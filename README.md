# Beat-Box-Program
A beat box synthesizer created in Java using the MIDI, I/O, and Networking libraries in order to provide the user with a chat room to share beats they've produced, save beats, and more functionality. (THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL SOUND FILES ON MAC, AS MAC IS LACKING THE REQUIRED MIDI FILES). I AM WORKING ON A MAC IMPLEMENTATION.
